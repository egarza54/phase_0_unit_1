I found this whole experience fun and very eye opening. The method of wireframing simplifies the designing process which could have been useful when designing my cultural and tech blogs. I enjoy learning about the designing process of programmers and graphic designers. My biggest challenge for both blogs was creating a aesthetically pleasing site. While I'm starting to get the hang of html/css, designing a site to look pretty has been a challenge. I had to make many designing compromises along the way. I do plan on going back to redesign my sites after learning more, I've learned that keeping a site simple is not only best but its probably best to look at, too. 

Reverse engineering the three sites were useful to do. instinctively, I had ideas of drawing out my sites before coding, but I decided to go right into programming. Had I chose to stop and plot my ideas on paper I might have saved a lot of time. Live and learn.
