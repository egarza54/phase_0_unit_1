I'm really getting into learning to program in html/css. This has been one of the more enjoyable challenges yet. Although I did have fun, I didn't leave without having any questions:
1) 	What would be the proper method of creating a sidebar within a blog?
2) 	How I can I create a margin on the left and right side of my blog, 	   	while maintaining my image in the center?
3)	How can keep my footer underneath the body of my blog?

There are others, but it more so than having difficulty udnerstanding how the margins, padding, and borders work on a site, while simultaneously working with my sidebars, borders, and padding within the body of my content. I've been using multiple resources trying to figure how all of this works. Some are as follows:

http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/
http://www.cssreset.com/how-to-keep-footer-at-bottom-of-page-with-css/http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web

I did manage to create a pretty website, I'm still not happy with it. I'm just not yet comfortable with using all of the functions of html/css as I'd like to be. Maybe its just part of being patient and learn as I go along the units and challenges. I didn't find any of parts challenges difficult, but what was difficult was finding the correct resources that could help me figure out what I wanted to do.
