## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I think I need to tone it down. Last night I spent over 4-5 hours trying to figure a very specfic way to create a sidebar on my blog, rather than using the already simple method that I know. I looked at source code from other blogs, searched in other html/css tutorials, and in additon to meticulously reading through slides already provided by DBC. From hear on out, I think it will be best to keep things simple and staying focused on mastering the concepts that understand. 

What I did come to realize was that those 5 hours went by very quickly. I really, really, enjoy programming!
