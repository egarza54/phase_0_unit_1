I liked the tutorials, slides, and different web resources in this exercise. It was a good refresh since the last time I practiced HTML/CSS in codecademy. Although I'm not even close in being an expert, I at least feel comfortable with the code and syntax of both languages. By describing the code as the "head" and "body" makes it easier for me to understand and remeber what type of code is written in both sections. I am a little worried that is so much to remember, I'll forget some syntax and I will have to constantly rely on my notes to help guide me. 

Before entering DBC, I practiced both HTML and CSS using codecademy. The site can be found here:

I enjoyed its tutorial very much and was a very good introduction into working with html and css.
