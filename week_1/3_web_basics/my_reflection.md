I didn't know how websites actually worked. I new there was an internet, websites, html files, and web apps, but I wasn't clear on how all of that came together. Our web browser is the tool that takes a file (be it an html file) thats loaded on a server (large computer that holds the website files) and loads it so that we can see it and interact with it. JavaScript is a the language used to make web apps, which are different from sites, because of the capablity of interacting with the "site." Similiar to facebook, twitter, or powerschool. 

When setting up your website I'll need to do the following:
1)	Buy the domain name
2)	Find a host for the website (a organization that lends out servers for a monthly fee)
3) 	Specify name servers for the domain (this is optional)
4) 	Point the domain name at the IP Address

But before even setting up the site, I'll need to think about:
1)	How to deepen the engagement of the user
2)	Increase the conversation
3)	Raise user satisfaction
4)	Bring users back

After setting up my index.html file and making it live, I felt like its finally beginning. I already knew a little HTML from using on codecademy and codeschool, but it's all becoming real now. This is a career change for me. Its a change that I'm ready for and I'm eager to learn more. Something about typing that code in my text file, that got me. I'm ready to get this going!
