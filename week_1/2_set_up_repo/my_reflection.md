## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a Repository

The first step of creating a repository on GitHub is to click the "+New" button, under the repository tab in your profile page. Then, you would name the repository using your username followed by ".github.io." Writing a description is optional. After making your repository public, you then check the box near the end of the page, initializing the repository with a README. Finally, give your repository an MIT open source license. 

To clone your new repository locally on your computer, open the GitHub desktop app, and click on your profile. Search for your specific reopsitory and click "Clone to your computer" at the far right of the window. 

Open Source

Open source software is a way to for the public to freely share programs, code, or software while allowing anyone to change the source code for their own customization. 

Open source software is great for innovation and allowing programmers to expereiment to existing code, possibly leading to new ideas. While it does make me a little nervous, since you would be allowing everyone on the web to look at your code and possibly take your ideas, it does extend its boundaries. Also, from a student perspective, I can use open source code as a learning tool, helping me see how other programmers solve problems or present new ways of creating a code. 

If there's an interest in allowing others to view and manipulate your code, licenses are useful in making sure your program is open source. Each type of licenses grants different rights, depending on any restrictions one would want for their program or software. The license we used is the MIT licenses, which is the least restrictive. It grants users the access of the program/software, to use it freely, copy it, or modify it. 

Solidified Concepts

I'm gaining some confidence after finishing this exercise. The uses of git/github are starting to settle in and I'm beginning to see why all of these resources are important to know and understand for Dev Bootcamp. Since completeing the repo, I began experimenting with my terminal. Although I didn't much, by just working with it more often is giving me more of a sense as to how all different parts fit together. I can't wait to see whats next!
