<!-- Hey everyone,

I'm Edgar, from Detroit but I live in Chicago. I've been here for 5 years now and I love it.  If you'd like some insider info on good places to look for to lease don't hesitate to let me know. I live in Albany Park, which is really close to the Brown Line, but there some other places in Chicago that have easy access to public trans if you don't have a car. Biking is also a safe bet, especially in the summer. Anyhow here's more info on me:
