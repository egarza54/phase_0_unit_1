## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Before entering this program I never entered my Mac's terminal unless I did it accidentally. Its just so foreign to me. I always thought that I was going to damamge my computer if I messed around with it. I've since learned that it's actually a very useful tool, but the struggles will still there. I had to do some reviewing from my notes from the time I was completing the Command Line tutorial during pre-phase 0 in order to understand what exactly I was doing. After some time reviewing and working through the notes, Git was officially installed, and it was done a lot smoother than expected. 

Git and GitHub also seems to be extremely useful. I am able to share my code, work on programs without interrupting or overlapping the work of my teammates, and can easily copy other people's files so that I may work on it. It was confusing to understand the difference at first, but one of the readings that really defined the two especially well by comparing it to dropbox. Git is the software used by programmers to version control there code while sharing and working with others, which is saved locally on their computers. While GitHub can be described as the "dropbox" of your computer. It is where programmers can save their code remotely, on the internet, and share it with other programmers. 

By sharing code through a version control like GitHub, many programmers are able to work on a large project at once increasing efficency and cutting down the risk losing work by "committing" the changes on a file rather than saving the file. In a program like Dev Bootcamp, where mistakes are probably are a very common occurance, reducing risk is can be important. As a beginner, I have some reassurance that any mistakes made will not create any major draw backs from the use Git and GitHub.
