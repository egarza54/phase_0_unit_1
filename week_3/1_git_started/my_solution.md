## Release 6: Reflection

I'm still not very confident in using Git. I think I understand how Git and GitHub communicates,  but pushing and fetching to and from a main file is still a little confusing. I've created a repository locally but when I try pushing it to my GitHub the file isn't there. Do I first create the repository on GitHub then fetch that to my computer, cloning it, do I create the repo on GitHub and just update it through my command lines (i.e. git init to git push)? I'm not sure. Everything ran smoothly while going through the many prompts listed on the provided resources, but making the connection to Git and GitHub is still confusing. I plan on pushing and commited everything using the command lines in during this week in order to gain a better understanding. hopefully by the end I'll have a good idea on how my computer communicates to GitHub in when I finish.
