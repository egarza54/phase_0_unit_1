# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I'm a high school math teacher.  That means I spending about 60-70 hours a week meeting with students, lesson planning, grading papers, talking with parents, teaching students, and then teaching night school.  The schedule is pretty busy already. I'm biggest challenge is just keeping with up everything and everyone.  I feel that I'm always behind and constantly catching.  Lucky the year is almost finished.  Once we're done I can spend more time with DBC and hopefully backtrack to learn what I have missed. 

I've been trying to keep a set time during when I can work on assignments at least 3 nights during the weekday and finish the rest on the weekend.  Weekends have been a saving grace for me.  Unfortunately that leaves me no time to go outside or spend time with friends and family.  If you ask any teacher, they’ll probably tell you that happy hour on Friday, is LITERALLY the happiest day of the week.  We work to hard to not unwind.  Fortunately for me, I’m a complete geek and working on programming is fun for me.  Yet, even with all that, its tough. 

Lately I have been getting into a zone.  My secret, strangely enough, listening to classical music.  I’m not even that big of a fan but somehow it gets me going. I go to this place where my brain isn’t easily distracted, which definitely not been the case before starting Phase-0. 

Meditating seems to work as well. Before I start working on the DBC exercises I try to center myself by taking the time to close my eyes and sit still for a few minutes.  At first, it was only for 2 or 3 minutes but lately I’ve been hitting 10-15 minutes. It has improved my concentration dramatically and I plan on continuing this as we progress through DBC.

My plan for Phase-0 is to learn as much as I can but to take it one day at a time.  I’ve learned my lesson in week 1 when I spent 3 hours trying to create a navigation bar for my tech blog.  Eventually I compromised with myself to learn this later and implement it to a future site and now my main page has the nav bar that I wanted for my first techblog.  It is these lessons that I have to remember and keep telling myself that some things need to be put on a shelf for later. Hopefully I can keep this up until July.  I’m sure I will.
