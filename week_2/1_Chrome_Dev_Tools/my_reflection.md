# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

DOM (Document Object Model) is the program interface for the HTML of a website or the way we manipulate plain text into a dynamic and interactive website. It is the way of defining what each element does within the design interface, how those elements are structure in the document, and establishes the relationship between those different elements. Although, I'm not quite sure how it all works. Is the DOM the description of the interface or the interface itself? Is it the way we enter in the code within the program? Some parts are very unclear to me.

I was surpised to see that the wordpress sites were not as complicated as expected. The design are way beyond my skill level however I am able to make sense of a lot of the coding. Much of the HTML/CSS used were very familiar. I was expecting the sites to be much more complex. 

Chrome Web Tools would is extremely helpful. I was able to see the changes on my website immediately and the best part was noticing how each element of the html and css affected the website. However, I'm still having difficulty manipulating my site. Padding, margins, and borders still remain an issue and may needed some tutoring. I've been trying to change my techblog by adding buttons and a navigation bar and I just can't get it right at the moment. While the Web Tools did show me what I was doing wrong, arriving to a solution to my problem still remains. 

Just keep swimming.
