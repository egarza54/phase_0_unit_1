##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS
    (Using Chrome's Dev Tools inspector in the elements tab. The elements tab   
      displays html code on the left while displaying CSS on the right. One can 
      edit the code in realtime, in either of these prompts.)

  * Javascript Debugging
     (The Javascript debugger is located in the sources tab.)

  * Performance Optimization 
    (After running the downloaded app PageSpeed, a programmer can analyze a      
      page in order to optimization for faster loading times.)

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
    (option+command+i: MacBook Pro)

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the imgs directory in the `1_Chrome_Dev_Tools` directory.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.
(The text cannot be edited as it is an image.)

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
     (The largest image is lg-share-en.gif)
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.
      (First by analyzing the webpage through PageSpeed, one can find the sizes of different files/apps through the network tab. The largest image can be found at the url, http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif, and its size is 2.0 kB.)

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the easiest thing to change to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?

(The easiest thing to change is optimizing the images, saving 207.7 KiB.)
