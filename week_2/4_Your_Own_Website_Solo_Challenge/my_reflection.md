# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: egarza54.github.io/unit1_projects/Garzablog.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


I'm finally getting the hang of margins, padding and borders. Now my focus is learning how to make a better navbar. Sometimes I just can't get the navbar to do what I want without putting some major time into it. I have trouble getting the bar centered of the page and spacing the buttons is just difficult. But, I definitely feel like I'm making progress. I'm very excited to learn how to apply media queries on my sites. 

It was fun making the site but I do have to work on my creative skills. While I find that I'm improving in writing code, what I have been neglecting is really analyzing other websites. I'd like to create a functioning AND dynamic site. The sites that I've created have been very plain and archaic. Using a wireframe has been useful but I can sometimes fool myself in thinking my page will be sleek with its simple design, when in reality its just a plain as the others that I've created. Not a big deal I suppose. I'm still learning after all. 

I'd like to add some drop down menus for my navigation bar and use it as a way to archive prior projects.  It'll be great if I can use this blog as a way to share all my projects in phase 0. Also, having a responsive design would be nice. I haven't really strayed out into the programming "rabbit hole," but i'm definitely looking.
