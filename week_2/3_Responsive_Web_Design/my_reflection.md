A webpage using responsive design would be able adapt to multiple screen sizes or devices. It can change the way a user views the site based on the screen size using relative widths and media quires. Its a great for customizing websites so that it can be properly viewed from different devices and screen sizes, maintaining a stable user experience.

The usage of smartphones and tablets have changed the way programmers design a website. Since the adoption of such devices, there was a need for responsive design. It considered the different ways a user would visit a website, while providing an efficient way for programmers to write code that adapted these different experiences.New advancements technology will only diversify the way a user experiences the web. This should affect how programmers design website in order to accommodate these advancements.

I can only imagine how a visually impaired person would experience the web. The use of captions, adhereing to specific color palettes, voiceovers, are a few examples of accommadations that websites can provide to the visually impaired. 

I'm interested in learning more about media queires. The use of customizing a webpage to fit the user's needs is important immpliment. It equalizes user's experience regardless of the device being used. I'd like to use it on my own sites.
