# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I like the structure of  web standards. Learning them helps me keep my web page organized and after some practice they're pretty easy to follow. Although, I did become frustrated as I learned how to use them. Sometimes, I'm not sure whether I'm using the correctly and I often use simple trial and error whenever I'm using code that is unfamiliar with me. The only way I'll be able to learn everything is if I practice consistently and while experimenting with the sites that I've created so far. 

The new HTML5 elements are useful to keep track with the structure of the website, but I'm confused as to how they affect the webpage itself. Is it just another method for organizing code or does it supposed to affect the page directly. While going through the practice (horse for sale) I didn't see much of a change to the webpage when comparing it to code using divs. Does the new HTML5 affect webpages?

I find that reseting css standardizes the webpage, such that it will be easier to identify the modifications put into the html code thus identifying the modifications on the webpage itself. 

Since owning a Mac I've defaulted my browser with Safari, Fireofox, to then settling with Chrome. I find it that Chrome is able to function on most websites and tends to load webpages faster in comparision to other browsers   (although that might be all in my head). However, some sites sports site that I visit, tend to run better on firefox or safari. The content on PistonPowered.com for example, would change in background color to red or blue making it difficult to read if I use Chrome. If using safari, the background color would remain white. I'm not sure why this is so, but it might be a good exercise if I can figure out why. 

I finding that w3schools.com to be my go to site whenever I'm confused on how I should be using an attritube. Its a great site that teaches me how to properly impliment code that I'm unfamiliar with, giving me step instructions, as well as examples that I can modify.
